Getting comfortable with multithreaded programs and makefiles for a recent assignment

The file "tutorial_ref" contains all the files from the following tutorial:<br>
http://www.cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/maketutor/<br>

In order to complete this exercise, I installed "g++" and "make" on Ubuntu. 

#Threads
The file "practice_threads" contains a program that creates three threads and has each print a "hello" statement.

Use "make" to compile the program.
Then use "./practice_thread" to run it.
